demo-framework
==============

A very lightweight MVC framework originally crafted from a tutorial
This sample framework has been heavily modified from the original tutorial I'd found (and sadly cannot find again to credit/blame.)
It should be PSR compliant up to and including PSR-2. (Though admittedly, there have been several edits since I last ran the code sniffer to test for comliance.)

Please feel free to subject it to a peer review and find faults, it's how I can learn.
Additionally, please feel free to use it a starting point for your own projects that need only the barest of bare bones skeletal frameworks.

As of 2013.06.06, this code has not even been manually tested. I have no idea if it works as-is or not.
I stripped all of the proprietary code out of a working copy, and added a few sample files.
It *should* work, but I have not written or run any UnitTests or manual tests. 


Thanks.
