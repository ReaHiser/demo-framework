demo-framework
==============

A very lightweight MVC framework originally crafted from a tutorial
This sample framework has been heavily modified from the original tutorial I'd found (and sadly cannot find again to credit/blame.)
It should be PSR compliant up to and including PSR-2. (Though admittedly, there have been several edits since I last ran the code sniffer to test for comliance.)

Please feel free to subject it to a peer review and find faults, it's how I can learn.
Additionally, please feel free to use it a starting point for your own projects that need only the barest of bare bones skeletal frameworks.

Thanks.
